# Installation

## Compatibility

| Filament version | Package version |
|------------------|-----------------|
| 4.x & 5.x        | 1.x             |

Heatmap Widget requires PHP 8.2 or later and `filament/filament`.

## Install the package

Install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require awcodes/heatmap-widget
```

The service provider is registered automatically through Laravel's package discovery, so
there is nothing to add to `config/app.php`.

## Registering the views with your theme

The widget's markup is styled with Tailwind classes, which means your theme has to be
told to scan the package's Blade files when it builds its stylesheet. Without this step
the widget renders, but unstyled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have not set up a custom theme and are using Filament Panels, follow the
> instructions in the [Filament documentation](https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/styling/overview#creating-a-custom-theme)
> before continuing.

Once you have a custom theme, add the package's views as a source in your theme's CSS
file — or in your application's CSS file if you are using the standalone Filament
packages:

```css
@source '../../../../vendor/awcodes/heatmap-widget/resources/**/*.blade.php';
```

Then rebuild your assets so the new classes are compiled in.

## Publishing the views

Publishing the views is optional, and only needed if you want to change the widget's
markup rather than its configurable properties:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="heatmap-widget-views"
```

Once published, the views live in your application and take precedence over the
package's own. Keep in mind that published views no longer receive upstream changes when
the package is updated.

With the package installed, continue to [Usage](usage.md) to build your first heatmap.
